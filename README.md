# Spring-Webflux-Example

A small example to understand reactive programming and spring webflux. I have experimented with basic reactive concepts like Flux, Mono, handling backpressure, map and merge. Finally, I have build a stock ticker application that constantly updates the stock prices of companies on the web using Spring Webflux and Server Side Eventing.
